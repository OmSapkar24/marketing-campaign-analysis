# Marketing Campaign Analysis

This project aims to analyze the effectiveness of marketing campaigns and predict conversion rates based on various factors such as campaign type, budget, impressions, and other features. The analysis utilizes machine learning techniques to predict conversion rates, helping marketers understand how different campaigns contribute to conversions.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to build a predictive model for marketing campaigns, particularly focusing on predicting conversion rates. A variety of features such as campaign budget, impressions, clicks, and audience segments are used to predict the conversion rates of campaigns.

## Data Description

The dataset includes various attributes that describe each marketing campaign:
- `Campaign_ID`: Unique identifier for each campaign.
- `Campaign_Name`: Name of the campaign.
- `Campaign_Type`: Type of campaign (e.g., Email, Social Media, TV, Influencer, etc.).
- `Start_Date`: Start date of the campaign.
- `End_Date`: End date of the campaign.
- `Budget`: Total budget allocated to the campaign.
- `Impressions`: Number of times the campaign was viewed.
- `Clicks`: Number of clicks on the campaign.
- `Conversions`: Number of successful conversions (e.g., purchases).
- `Conversion_Rate`: The percentage of impressions that resulted in conversions.
- `Revenue`: Revenue generated by the campaign.
- `Target_Audience`: Customer segments targeted by the campaign (e.g., age groups).

## Steps Involved

1. **Data Loading**: Importing the data and exploring its structure.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and ensuring data consistency.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features (e.g., campaign duration), and one-hot encoding categorical variables (e.g., campaign type and target audience).
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing distributions and relationships between features.
5. **Model Training**: Splitting the data into training and testing sets and training models such as **Linear Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating models using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R-squared**.
7. **Saving the Model**: Saving the trained model for future use.

## Modeling

In this project, several machine learning models are used to predict conversion rates:

- **Linear Regression**: A simple model used for prediction.
- **Random Forest**: A powerful ensemble method to improve prediction accuracy.
- **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**: A regression model that works well for high-dimensional data.

The models were trained on the features derived from the dataset and evaluated on test data.

## Results and Evaluation

The model was evaluated using the **R-squared** metric, which indicates how well the model explains the variance in conversion rates. The **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** was also used to measure the prediction accuracy.

- **R-squared**: 0.774 (77.4% of the variance explained).
- **MSE**: 0.00086 (Low value, indicating accurate predictions).

The scatter plot comparing actual vs. predicted conversion rates shows a close alignment with the **red dashed line**, which represents perfect predictions. There are a few outliers, but overall, the model performs well.
